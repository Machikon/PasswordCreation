# Password Creation Project
My application allows users to create password by following prompts. The prompts lead the user to choose certain criteria, including the length of password and whether or not s/he wants to include certain character types in the password.

## Technologies used
- html 
- JavaScript (Using starter-code, I added code (var, function, if, array, prompt/confirm, concat, Math.random, etc.)

## Features 
1. When user clicks on the password generation button, seriese of prompts are presented to users to respond. 
2. Users are also able to choose/enter a number for the length of password between eight and 128 characters. If the length is less than/larger than the length requirement, no more prompt is presented to users - password generating process ends here.
3. User are able to select/confirm whether s/he wants to use certain character types such as lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters in the password.

## Challenges
1. Password generation to meet user's selection has not been enabled yet.
2. Random passwords have not been generated yet.
3. Randomly generated password is not displayed in an alert or written to the page.
